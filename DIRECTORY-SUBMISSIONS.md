## Short Description (50-100 words)

BoxLite is an embeddable virtual machine runtime that lets you run untrusted code in hardware-isolated micro-VMs. Unlike Docker containers that share the host kernel, BoxLite provides true VM-level isolation where even kernel exploits can't escape. Perfect for AI agent sandboxing, secure code execution, and multi-tenant isolation. Sub-second boot times, no daemon required, just import and sandbox. Open source with Python, Rust, and C SDKs.

## Medium Description (150-200 words)

BoxLite is an open-source, embeddable virtual machine runtime designed for secure execution of untrusted code. It provides hardware-isolated micro-VMs that boot in under 100ms, making it ideal for AI agent sandboxing, secure code execution platforms, and multi-tenant SaaS applications.

Unlike Docker containers that share the host kernel (and are vulnerable to container escapes), BoxLite runs each workload in its own micro-VM with a separate kernel. This means even if malicious code achieves a kernel exploit, it remains contained within its sandbox.

Key features:
- Hardware isolation via KVM (Linux) and Hypervisor.framework (macOS)
- OCI/Docker image compatibility
- Sub-second boot times (~100ms)
- No daemon required - embeddable as a library
- Python, Rust, and C SDKs
- Built-in networking, storage, and volumes
- Native Apple Silicon support

BoxLite is perfect for running AI-generated code from Claude, GPT, or other LLMs, online code judges, browser automation, and any scenario where you need to execute code you don't fully trust.

## Long Description (300+ words)

BoxLite is an open-source, embeddable virtual machine runtime that provides hardware-isolated sandboxes for running untrusted code. Built for the age of AI agents, BoxLite lets you safely execute code generated by LLMs like Claude, GPT, and other AI systems without risking your host system.

**The Problem**

Modern AI agents can write and execute code, but running AI-generated code directly on your system is dangerous. One hallucination could delete files, expose secrets, or compromise your infrastructure. Traditional Docker containers provide some isolation, but they share the host kernel—container escape vulnerabilities (like CVE-2024-21626) have allowed attackers to break out and access the host.

**The Solution**

BoxLite provides true VM-level isolation using micro-VMs. Each sandbox runs its own Linux kernel, completely separated from your host. Even if malicious code achieves a kernel exploit inside the sandbox, it cannot escape to affect your system.

**Key Features**

- **Hardware Isolation**: Uses KVM on Linux and Apple's Hypervisor.framework on macOS for true VM boundaries
- **Lightning Fast**: Micro-VMs boot in ~100ms, not minutes
- **No Daemon**: Unlike Docker, BoxLite is an embeddable library—just `import boxlite` and go
- **OCI Compatible**: Run any Docker/OCI image in a BoxLite sandbox
- **Multi-Platform**: Native support for Linux (x86_64, ARM64) and macOS (Apple Silicon)
- **Developer Friendly**: Python, Rust, and C SDKs with async-first design

**Use Cases**

- **AI Agent Sandboxing**: Run Claude Computer Use, GPT Code Interpreter, AutoGPT safely
- **Secure Code Execution**: Online judges, coding playgrounds, educational platforms
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: SaaS platforms, hosting providers, enterprise applications
- **Browser Automation**: Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium in isolated environments
- **Development Environments**: Fast, isolated dev environments without Docker Desktop

BoxLite is open source under the Apache 2.0 license and actively maintained by BoxLite Labs.

## Product Hunt Submission

**Tagline:** Secure sandboxing for AI agents - run untrusted code in hardware-isolated micro-VMs

**Description:**
BoxLite lets you safely execute AI-generated code in hardware-isolated micro-VMs. Unlike Docker containers that share the host kernel, BoxLite provides true VM isolation where even kernel exploits can't escape.

Perfect for:
- Running Claude/GPT-generated code safely
- Online code judges and playgrounds
- Multi-tenant SaaS isolation
- Browser automation sandboxes

Features:
- ~100ms boot time
- OCI/Docker image compatible
- No daemon - just `import boxlite`
- Python, Rust, C SDKs
- Native Apple Silicon support

**Maker Comment:**
We built BoxLite because existing sandboxing solutions weren't secure enough for AI agents. Docker's container model shares the host kernel, making it vulnerable to escape attacks. Traditional VMs are too slow. BoxLite gives you the security of VMs with the speed developers expect.

## Hacker News Post

- Show HN: BoxLite – Secure code execution without Docker's kernel sharing

**Post:**
Hey HN,

We built BoxLite to solve a problem we kept running into: how do you safely run code generated by AI agents?

Docker shares the host kernel, so container escapes are possible (and have happened—see CVE-2024-21626). Firecracker provides real isolation but requires a daemon and isn't designed to be embedded.

BoxLite is an embeddable VM runtime. Just `import boxlite` in Python and you can spin up hardware-isolated micro-VMs in ~100ms. Each sandbox has its own kernel, so even kernel exploits can't escape.

Key features:
- Hardware isolation via KVM/Hypervisor.framework
- OCI image compatible (run Docker images)
- No daemon—it's a library
- Python, Rust, C SDKs
- Native Apple Silicon support

We're using it to sandbox AI agents that can execute arbitrary code. Also useful for online judges, multi-tenant platforms, browser automation, etc.

Would love feedback from the community!

**Title:** BoxLite: Hardware-isolated sandboxes for running untrusted code (open source)

**Post:**
Built an open-source alternative to running untrusted code in Docker containers. BoxLite uses micro-VMs instead of containers, so you get real hardware isolation—each sandbox has its own kernel.

Main use cases:
- AI agent sandboxing (running LLM-generated code)
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Secure code execution platforms

Unlike Docker, container escapes aren't possible because there's an actual VM boundary. Unlike Firecracker, it's an embeddable library—no daemon needed.

Happy to answer questions!

### r/python

**Title:** BoxLite: Run untrusted Python code in hardware-isolated micro-VMs

**Post:**
If you've ever needed to run user-submitted Python code safely (online judges, AI agents, coding platforms), check out BoxLite.

```python
import boxlite

async with boxlite.CodeBox() as box:
    result = await box.run("print('Hello from sandbox!')")
    print(result.stdout)
```

Each sandbox is a micro-VM with its own kernel, not a container. Boot time is ~100ms. The VM is destroyed after use.

Why not Docker? Containers share the host kernel. Container escape vulnerabilities have allowed attackers to break out. VMs provide a much stronger boundary.

## Twitter/X Announcements

**Launch tweet:**
Launching BoxLite - embeddable micro-VMs for running AI-generated code safely.

Docker shares the kernel. VMs are slow. BoxLite gives you hardware isolation with ~100ms boot times.

Perfect for AI agent sandboxing.

Open source: github.com/boxlite-labs/boxlite

**Thread:**
1/ We built BoxLite because running AI-generated code is terrifying.

One hallucination from Claude or GPT could `rm -rf` your home directory or send your env vars to a remote server.

Here's how we solved it:

2/ Docker isn't enough. Containers share the host kernel. Container escape vulnerabilities (like CVE-2024-21626) have let attackers break out.

For truly untrusted code, you need a VM boundary.

3/ But VMs are slow, right? Traditional VMs take minutes to boot.

BoxLite uses micro-VMs that boot in ~100ms. Fast enough to spin up per-request.

4/ And unlike Firecracker, BoxLite is an embeddable library.

No daemon. No complex setup.

Just: `import boxlite`

5/ Use cases:
- AI agent sandboxing (Claude, GPT, AutoGPT)
- Online code judges
- Multi-tenant SaaS
- Browser automation
- Dev environments

6/ Open source under Apache 2.0.

Excited to share BoxLite - an open-source project we've been building for secure AI agent sandboxing.

As AI agents become more capable of writing and executing code, security becomes critical. How do you run AI-generated code without risking your infrastructure?

Docker containers aren't enough - they share the host kernel and escape vulnerabilities are real. Traditional VMs are too slow for per-request isolation.

BoxLite provides hardware-isolated micro-VMs that boot in ~100ms. Each sandbox has its own kernel, making escape attacks extremely difficult.

Key features:
- Hardware isolation via KVM/Hypervisor.framework
- OCI/Docker image compatibility
- No daemon - embeddable as a library
- Python, Rust, C SDKs
- Native Apple Silicon support

Perfect for:
- Running LLM-generated code safely
- Online code execution platforms
- Multi-tenant SaaS isolation
- Browser automation sandboxes
